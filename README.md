# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project uses the classic Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on features like age, fare, gender, and class.

## 📌 Objective
Build a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival using exploratory data analysis and classification algorithms.

## 🔍 Key Concepts Learned
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with seaborn & matplotlib
- Training models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1-score

## 🧪 Model Results
Final Accuracy: **81.0%** using Random Forest Classifier

[[89 16]
[18 56]]


## 📊 Visualizations
- Heatmap for feature correlation
- Histograms to observe age vs. survival
- Countplots for gender and Pclass vs. survival
- Boxplot for Fare vs. survival

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Future Plans
- Improve feature engineering
- Try advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM
- Deploy using Streamlit
