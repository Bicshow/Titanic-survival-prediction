# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This is my first end-to-end Machine Learning project using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## 📌 Objective
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, fare, class, and gender.

## 📊 Technologies & Concepts Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
- Data Cleaning, Label Encoding, Model Evaluation

## 📈 Model Performance
Achieved **81% accuracy** using a Random Forest Classifier.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Titanic_Model.ipynb`: Complete code with explanations and visualizations
- `README.md`: This file
- (Optional) `requirements.txt`: Python libraries

## ✅ What I Learned
- How to handle and explore datasets
- Visualizing relationships using heatmaps, countplots, and boxplots
- Training ML models and evaluating them
- The importance of data preprocessing and feature selection

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Try other models like SVM, XGBoost
- Add a user input interface using Streamlit or Flask
